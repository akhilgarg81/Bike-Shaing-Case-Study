## General Information
- Analysis on Bike rental data and Model building.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. ?
- They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
- Mnth : In March, September and October high number of bike users. We can observe in linear regression equation July month negatively impacting the user count
- Seasons: Summer and fall high number of bike users. Sprint has lowest number of users.We can observe in linear regression equation spring season negatively impacting the user count
- Holiday: On non holiday high number of users. We can observe in linear regression equation holiday negatively impacting the user count
- Year: Year 2019 have high number of users in comparison of 2018. We can observe in linear regression equation year is positively impacting the user count
- Weather situation: On clear day we can observe high number of users. We can observe in linear regression equation mist weather is negatively impacting the user count
